HarmonicMotion
==============

Demonstrating an interesting experiment in harmonic motion.

I was first made aware of this experiment in
[a blog post](http://syntacticsalt.com/2011/08/27/harmonic-motion-simulation/)
by @mjsottile ([Matt Sottile](http://syntacticsalt.com/about/)).  He used Haskell to build
[his model](https://github.com/mjsottile/publicstuff), which triggered a
conversation with @thorade ([Matthis Thorade](https://twitter.com/MatthisThorade))
about using Modelica to do the same.

The experiment is so fascinating that I had to try this out.  As always, I'm releasing the models
for public consumption and I've written [a blog post about it](https://whiteboard.modelica.university/blog/harmonic-motion/).

To run the model, simply simulate the `HarmonicMotion.System` model.
